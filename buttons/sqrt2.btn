;; button code to approximate square root of 2

PUSH 2      ; 2 or any number to compute its square root
STOR AX     ; 
PUSH 1      ; initial guess
STOR BX     ; 
  DIV       ; 2/guess 
RSTOR BX    ; guess
ADD         ; 2/guess + guess 
PUSH 2      ; preprare for doing average
DIV         ; improved guess = (2/guess + guess)/2
STOR BX
PUSH 2      ; prepare for next 2 / improve guess
RSTOR    BX ; add spaces
JUMP  		4   ; add tabs and spaces
